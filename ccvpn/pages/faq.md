Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

General
-------

### Do you support IPv6?
Yes!

### Can I have a static IP address?
Not at the moment.

### Will you support PPTP?
No, for security reasons.

### Do you monitor or limit bandwidth usage?
No, every user share each VPN server's connection.  
We always try to have enough bandwidth (at least 20Mbps) available
for everyone.

No and we will never do it.

### Which protocols are supported?
We only support OpenVPN for now.

### Which payment methods are supported?
We support Paypal and Bitcoin.  
Feel free to ask [the support](/page/support) if you need any other method.

Account
-------

### Can I have a trial account?
Yes, we provide 7 days trial accounts.  
You just have to [sign up](/account/signup) and [contact us](/page/support).

### Can I use my account on multiple machines?
Yes, you can! Up to 10 times!  
You have to create a profile for each machine to be able to use
them at the same time.

### How can I delete my account?
Contact [the support](/page/support).


Legal
-----

### What do you log?
We only keep VPN connection IP addresses because of the law.  
We do not keep any data concerning your traffic.

### Is it really anonymous?
Depends of your definition of anonymous.  
It is anonymous, because we will not ask you for your name or verify your
identity to be able to use the VPN, and we use anonymous payment methods
like Bitcoin.  
It is anonymous, because no one can find out your identity from the other side
of the VPN.  
However, French authorities can ask us for user data. That's why we
recommend you to not use your usual username here so that your VPN account
cannot be associated to anything you do with it.


Frequent errors on Windows
--------------------------

    NETSH: C:\Windows\system32\netsh.exe interface ipv6 set address Connexion au réseau local
    ERROR: netsh command failed: returned error code 1

Rename your network connection to avoid spaces, for example "Connexion au réseau local" to "local".
