Frequently Asked Questions

General
-------

### What is a VPN?
A Virtual Private Network is a private network on the Internet.  
Here, it is made of our customers and our servers acts like routers.  
That means that everything goes through our servers, and you appear anonymous
on the Internet.  
Because of the strong encryption used, your ISP cannot log or
filter anything.

### Why should I pay to use it instead of tor?
Although tor may be free (and extremely good for some usage), tor is also very
slow.  
This means that tor is good if you want full anonymity, but not for
everyday web browsing, or to play an online game. For that, a VPN perfect.

### Do you propose an affiliate program?
Yes! Share your affiliate link and earn 2 weeks for each referral.  
Invite 24 friends and you get one year of free VPN!

### Do you support IPv6?
Yes!

### Can I have a static IP address?
Not at the moment.

### Will you support PPTP?
No, for security reasons.

### Do you monitor or limit bandwidth usage?
No, every user share each VPN server's connection.  
We always try to have enough bandwidth (at least 20Mbps) available
for everyone.

### Do you censor some websites or protocols?
No and we will never do it.

### Which protocols are supported?

### Which payment methods are supported?
We support Paypal and Bitcoin.  
Feel free to ask [the support](/page/support) if you need any other method.

### Is it open-source?
Yes! Our VPN is made with OpenVPN.  
Our servers' config and this website are also open-source and available on our
[GitHub project](https://github.com/CCrypto/ccvpn/).

### Are my data kept secure?
Yes, the VPN traffic is strongly encrypted and we do not keep any data on the
VPN servers.  
The website and database are on a different server, in a
different datacenter.

### Will there be more servers/countries available?
Yes, but we first need money to pay the servers.  
If you would like to have a server somewhere, know a good provider or would
like to host one, please contact us.

them at the same time.

Legal
-----

### What do you log?
We only keep VPN connection IP addresses because of the law.  
We do not keep any data concerning your traffic.

### Is it really anonymous?
Depends of your definition of anonymous.  
It is anonymous, because we will not ask you for your name or verify your
identity to be able to use the VPN, and we use anonymous payment methods
like Bitcoin.  
It is anonymous, because no one can find out your identity from the other side
of the VPN.  
However, French authorities can ask us for user data. That's why we
recommend you to not use your usual username here so that your VPN account
cannot be associated to anything you do with it.


Frequent errors on Windows
--------------------------

    NETSH: C:\Windows\system32\netsh.exe interface ipv6 set address Connexion au réseau local
    ERROR: netsh command failed: returned error code 1

Rename your network connection to avoid spaces, for example "Connexion au réseau local" to "local".
