Install on Windows
==================

First, you need to download OpenVPN:
[OpenVPN.net](http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html)  
Get the `Windows Installer` and install OpenVPN.

In [your account](/account/), download the config file (.ovpn) you want to use,
and copy it to `C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\`.

To start using it, run `OpenVPN GUI` you just installed **as Administrator**.  
In the Windows System Tray, you should see a OpenVPN icon;  
right click on it, and click on `Connect`.  

It may fail because of a known OpenVPN bug, if so please check the
[FAQ](/page/faq).  
If you have any questions, go to the [Support page](/page/support).
