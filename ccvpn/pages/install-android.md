==================

We recommend <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn">OpenVPN for Android</a>.

Download the .ovpn file you need in [your account](/account/) and save it somewhere on your Android device.

Then, start OpenVPN and import the .ovpn file.
Edit the imported profile and set your username and password.

You can now connect to that profile.
