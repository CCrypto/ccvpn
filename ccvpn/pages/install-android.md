Title: Install on Android

We recommend [Arne Schwabe's OpenVPN for Android][openvpn_android],
as it is the only enough uptodate OpenVPN app at the moment.

Download the .ovpn file you need in [your account](/account/) and save it
somewhere on your Android device.

Then, start OpenVPN and import the .ovpn file.  
Edit the imported profile and set your username and password if you do not
want to be asked every time.

You can now connect to that profile.

If you have any questions, go to the [Support page](/page/support).
